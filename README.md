# Have you ever been annoyed at having to change all the rarities of cards when you import a decklist from Limitless to PTCGL? Well, I made this tool to take a dictionary of cards that I have, and format a decklist copied from Limitless with those cards.

# This project would be unnecessary if either limitless had a way to keep track of which cards you own on ptcgl OR if the devs at PTCGL just implemented a "maximise rarity" button or something.
